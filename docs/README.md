# Admin List Interface

This application is a dependency of the [`vtex.list`](https://github.com/vtex/list) application. Its purpose is to create an interface in the admin where the shopkeepers can manage all the information coming from the gift list application.

In this interface we will have a list of all users that contain a gift list, with their respective amounts of lists, the value they have already won in gifts, the value converted into gift vouchers and whether or not there is already an active list at the moment, respectively. There is also the possibility of having more information about a specific user, with the information of each list of this user.

This app depends on `vtex.list-graphql` and `vtex.gift-card-list` configuration to work properly.
